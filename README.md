# GeoDjango Vue Leaflet Demo

## About: 

This project shows how to use Leaflet maps in a Django project. I use a simple Book model to illustrate different model fields and how they can be used across different parts of Django, such as views, forms, urls and templates. I will also be using additional models such as Author, Publisher and Like to illustrate various types of relations and how they can work together.

## Map data:
- 30 random locations in Berlin

## Used technologies:
- PostgreSQL, PostGIS
- Django, GeoDjango
- Django REST framework, django-rest-framework-gis
- Vue Leaflet
